I'm approaching my 7 years running anniversary. My first recorded run
was on the 10 February 2019, 5 km, starting from the wonderful [Centre
for Mathematical Sciences](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/) and running
along the West Cambriidge site. Since then, I have run on average 2000
km per year, tallying 11849.1 km. This post is a tribute to the
running shoes I have been wearing since.


## First pair: Asics cumulus (March 2016 - ?)

## Another Asics cumulus (June 2016 - ?)
