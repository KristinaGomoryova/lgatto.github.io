I have recently acquired a new running watch and wanted to give a
little tribute to my TomTom runner watch that has accompagnied my for
just over 6 years and 12000 kms. This watch doesn't come with all the
bells and whistles of other high end models, but it does exactly
what's written on the tin, and does it well. I used is to track and
record my runs. I however was keen to change it to benefit from longer
battery life (it did record a just over 10h run in 2019 - see below,
but I don't think it would manage anymore now) and I wanted to be able
to have maps integrated in my watch for longer runs and activites
abroad, without having to rely on a phone.

I got the watch in 2016, for my 40th birthday, a couple of month after
starting to run. Here are a few good memories that I wanted to
record. The screenshots are taken from the TomTom online software - as
is the watch, it's simple, to the point and useful.

The progress page shows an overview over these 6 years I used
the watch. Apparently, I recorded 985 activities, running 12550 kms
(there might be one or two non-running activities) in 1182 hours, and
climbing 149 km.

And here are the the last activities I recorded in June 2022, before
switching to a new device.

Clicking on each one open a page with the track and all details. The
screenshot below was taken from the phone app and features the
September 2019 Brussels Ecotrail, my longest run so far.

A last, rather funny memory is how TomTom estimated my fitness age
being 20 years old. Thank you, I'm flattered, and while I am likely
fitter than the average 46-years-old male, I guarantee that 20 is
*slighly* underestimated.
